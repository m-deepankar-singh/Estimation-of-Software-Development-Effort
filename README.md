# Estimation-of-Software-Development-Effort
A framework using GNN to predict software development effort. 

The computer software industry is perhaps one of the fastest
growing industries in the world today. With the increasing cost of
software development, it is apparent that effective techniques for
estimating software costs are essential in order to control the
costs and make software more competitive. Because of the highly
dynamic nature of the Software development, it becomes more
and more difficult to get a correct software effort estimation. A
number of algorithmic techniques have been developed and used
for software cost estimation. However, calculations from several
of such techniques indicate that estimates of development effort
and cost differ considerably and hence may pose problems to
software managers in committing resources and controlling costs.
Software cost estimation is the process of predicting the effort
required to develop a software system. Many estimation models
have been proposed over the last 30 years. These estimation
models are implemented in various frameworks for accurately
predicting software effort.
